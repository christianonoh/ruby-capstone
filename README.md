<!-- Features -->

### Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>

- **Multiple Collections:** Collectify allows you to create and manage multiple collections for different types of items, including books, music albums, movies, and games.

- **Listing and Filtering:** Collectify enables you to list and view all items in your collections by category, such as books, music albums, movies, or games. You can also filter items by specific genres, labels, authors, or sources to quickly find what you're looking for.

- **Archiving and Preservation:** The app includes a functionality to automatically archive items based on their published date or other criteria. This helps you identify and manage items that are older or no longer actively used, ensuring your catalog stays up to date.

- **Data Persistence:** Collectify securely stores your collections' data in JSON files, preserving your item information across app sessions. This ensures that your collections are readily available whenever you use the app.

- **Database Integration:** In addition to JSON file storage, Collectify provides the option to integrate with a corresponding database. This allows for scalability and flexibility in managing larger collections and provides a foundation for future enhancements.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The console app features a simple and intuitive user interface, guiding you through the process of managing your collections. The menu-based navigation makes it easy to perform actions such as adding items, listing collections, and applying filters.
